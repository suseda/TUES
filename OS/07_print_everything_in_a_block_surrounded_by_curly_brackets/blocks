So, in order to demonstrate the capabilities of our code
we need some blocks.
For example:
Block one:
{
	This is the verry first block!
}
block two: { The 2nd one is tricky, it's all in the same row }
{
	The 3th block is even trickier!
		{ because it contains a nested block }
		{ and another one! }
		{ my, oh my, how can we handle this situation? }
	We'll have to be precise
}
lets set a trap! } for our code. Will it correcty handle the fact there is no block } being oppened?
what if we open {another block} after the } trap?
